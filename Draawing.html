<h1>Drawing is fun :)&nbsp; &nbsp;</h1>
	<p>Drawing can let me calm down, while I'm sad, angry, or what ever, drawing will be a good choice for me. </p>
	<p>Also, drawing is a kind of diary for me. When I travil to places, I will drawing something related. Years later, when I look at my drawings again, it will help me to recall my memories. </p>
	<p>You can draw, or design a pattern taht you like, for exaple, the image below is a design by somebody who likes Ravenclaw. </p>
	<p>These are the reasons why I like drawing, drawing has a lot of benefits, hope you like it and try it. </p>
